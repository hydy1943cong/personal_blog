# personal_blog
This is a coding assignment for Module 4
In this challenge, I created a two-page website where users will input and view blog posts. It includes building a content form, dynamically rendering blog posts, and implementing a light/dark mode toggle. As you code, you'll gain practical JavaScript experience, explore the Document Object Model's power, and set the stage for more advanced tasks.

You can see the screenshots of the webpages below:
